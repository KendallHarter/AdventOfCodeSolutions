# Advent

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Haskell.

Done as a means to learn the Haskell language, started in 2020, also did some
from older years due to an unexpected desire to program.

## Running

To run use:

```bash
./run.sh [year] [day]
```

It's extremely basic so basically does no error handling, but will run all problems,
the specified year's problems, or the specified year's day's problem
